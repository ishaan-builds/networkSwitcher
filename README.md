# networkSwitcher
The two powershell scripts in this repo allow for fast Ethernet network switching, a feature that isn't on Windows on the software level, and currently requieres either manually replacing a cable, or disabling a port through Windows control centre.

These scripts automate the process of disabling one ethernet port of your computer and enabling another, and allow you to do so with a desktop shortcut.
