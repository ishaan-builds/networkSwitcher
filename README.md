# networkSwitcher
The two powershell scripts in this repo allow for fast Ethernet network switching on a computer that has multiple Ethernet ports each connected to a differant network, a feature that isn't on Windows on the software level and currently requires either manually replacing a cable, or disabling a port through Windows control center.

These scripts automate the process of disabling one ethernet port of your computer and enabling another, and allow you to further simplify the process with shortcuts that can be placed anywhere at your convenience.
