# networkSwitcher
The two powershell scripts in this repo allow for fast Ethernet network switching on a computer that has multiple Ethernet ports each connected to differant networks, a feature that isn't on Windows on the software level and currently requires either manually replacing a cable, or disabling a port through Windows control center. 

Although this is the primary usecase, the methodology in the initialSetup.md file can also be used to enable and disable one ethernet port and Wi-Fi adapter. Furthermore, the code can be easily modified to swap between three network interfaces.

These scripts automate the process of disabling one ethernet port of your computer and enabling another, and allow you to further simplify the process with shortcuts.
